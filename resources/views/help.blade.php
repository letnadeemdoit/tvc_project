                                            <p>Use the calendar to schedule, edit and delete vacations. Simply click on the first date that you are interested in and then specify the end date within the edit box that will appear. Additionally, you will be prompted to add the vacation name.
                                                Lastly, you have the option to select various colors to easily identify your vacations.
                                                To edit your vacation, simply click on any of the calendar days of your vacation and the edit box will appear so you can make any necessary changes.
                                                The calendar screen also allows you to view the vacations that are already scheduled for your vacation home. You can navigate month by month by clicking on the month links at the top of the calendar, or you can jump quickly to a specific month by specifying the date you want to jump to and then clicking the jump button. In addition to viewing vacations scheduled, you have the ability to request to join a vacation. Simply click on a vacation name that is a link and then fill out the information at the bottom of the next page to have TheVacationCalendar.com email the Owner who scheduled the vacation that you would like to join him for all or part of the vacation.</p>
                                            <h3>blog</h3>
                                            <p>The house blog is the location where conversations between all the different users of TheVacationCalendar.com website for your individual vacation home can take place. When you first access the screen the initial blogs are shown. By clicking the "Read Comments" link you can see what comments have been added to that thread. Additionally, you can add a comment to any thread by clicking the "Add Comment Link". Finally, if you want to start a new topic, you can click the "Add a New Blog" at the top of the page. One function that is available to the Administrator that is not available to any other user is the ability to delete blogs. You can use this to keep the blog screen tidy or to remove any inappropriate content.

                                            </p>

                                            <p>The administer users screen is the most important screen for the house administrator. This is where you create Owners of the house and give them access to the website. You are responsible for setting their initial password which the Owners can change themselves once they have accessed the website. You have the choice of setting up a new Owner with a confirmed account, or you can require that the Owner confirms the account before it can be used. In the latter case, an email is generated and is sent to the Owner's email account. The Owner then needs to open the email and click on the confirmation link which will activate the account.<b> Please note that these confirmation emails almost always end up in junk mail.</b>

                                            </p>

This is a great place to include house rules, driving instructions, favorite restaurants, and emergency contact information. Remember to save often.

                                            <p>The manage account screen for the Administrator has several options that are not available to other users. The most important option is whether you would like to have a single account to perform administrative and owner tasks. If you are the house administrator and want to be able to schedule vacations using the same login, select the "Allow Administrator to have Owner permissions" checkbox.

                                                Like other users you can keep you email address and password up to date. In addition you have the ability to unsubscribe from TheVacationCalendar.com website, change the Guest password for your vacation home, and update the picture that shows up in the top right corner of the website.</p>

                                            <p>TheVacationCalendar.com website was designed to try to appease as many people as possible. Initially, it built for my family when they decided they did not want to have only one person manage the "official" calendar for the beach house. But even within our family, we had all different types of users. Some loved the complexity and rich functionality, but most politely asked if there was an easier way. The website has evolved to be able to support various types of people. This guide will help you set up the house so that it meets your needs, no matter which category you fall into.

                                            <p>A single Guest account is set up during the initial setup of a new vacation home on the website however the password can be reset easily from the "manage account" screen. This is a generic password that allows users to view the activity on the website but cannot make any changes. You should feel free to send this password out to all of your friends and family who you want to be able to see who is using your vacation home. The Guest is able to click on a vacation and request to join. This will trigger an email to be sent to the Owner who scheduled the vacation.
